###Grading Guideline
+ Comments for grading v2: "I implemented everything on the web site's requirements"
+ Comments for grading v2.1: 
 I implemented everything on the web site's requirements. <br/> 
 To order specific food, enter the name of food as a customer's name.
+ Comments for grading v2.2:
 I implemented all requirements on the rubric of v2.2, including all extra credit requirements <br/>
 There are several hacks that I implemented to help grading. <br/>
 1. Selecting food: If you type certain name of food as name of a customer, the customer will be going to order the food with that name. If there is no stock available for the food, when a waiter asks the customer, the customer will order one of other items. <br/>
 2. Changing batch size per order to market: If you enter "!hack batch-#," the default batch size per order will change. # can be either 2 or 3. <br/>
 3. Make the cashier's current cash to $0: If you enter "!hack cashier-$-0," the cashier will have $0 no matter how much money he had.
 4. Make the market's current cash to $0: If you enter "!hack market-$-0," all markets will have $0 no matter how much money they had.
 5. Make the markets' current stock to 0: If you enter "!hack market-stock-0," all markets will have 0 stock for all foods.

 In order to check v2.2A easily, I would like to recommend to change batch size per order to either 2 or 3. Batch size of 3 will result in the scenario, "One order, fulfilled by TWO markets, 2 bills paid in full," while batch size of 2 will result in the scenario, "One order, fulfilled by the market, bill paid in full." <br/>
 For your information, default(starting) batch size is 3.
